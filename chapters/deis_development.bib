  abstract = {A measurement approach is described and data are presented which demonstrate the ability to effect a.c. cyclic voltammetric measurements with the on-line digital FFT approach to faradaic admittance data acquisition. The equipment utilized enables complete faradaic admittance spectra to be obtained at an effective spectrum acquisition rate of 10 s-1, so that the d.c. potential range encompassed by a typical cyclic wave can be encompassed with adequate resolution in the Edc dimension in {$\geq$}6 s, approximately. The instrument features dynamic, computerized measurement and compensation of the non-faradaic ohmic resistance and double-layer capacitance contributions to the acquired total cell admittance. Measurements with quasi-reversible systems yield the expected faradaic admittance and phase angle responses over a quite generous bandwidth. Applications to mercury and platinum electrodes are illustrated.},

  abstract = {A study is presented of faradaic admittance versus frequency measurements based on Fourier analysis of the response to multiple-frequency test signal waveforms. The waveform types employed encompass both the discrete frequency and broadband categories, including stochastic and deterministic examples of the latter. More specifically, data are acquired using: (a) complex periodic signals; (b) almost periodic signals; (c) transient inputs; and (d) bandwidth-limited white noise. Data analysis is based on the highly-efficient fast Fourier transform algorithm which is implemented by an on-line minicomputer. An instrumental configuration is described which yields valid faradaic admittance data, regardless of the type of test signal waveform employed. Results are examined with regard to the effect of test signal properties on measurement efficiency, where measurement efficiency is defined in terms of the data dispersion observed after a particular number of replicate measurements. In this context the data show that a complex periodic waveform composed of a fundamental harmonic and a sufficient number of odd harmonics is superior to the others which were examined. This result, together with the overall empirical ordering of waveform types versus measurement efficiency, is rationalized in terms of the influences of extraneous noise, faradaic non-linearity, waveform frequency spectrum, and special measurement system characteristics.},

As a result of this approach, it is possible to generate two novel impedance spectra from the primary impedance spectrogram. The innovation lies in the use of simple polynomials to describe a set of spectra, and then performing differential and division operations, which result in differential- and relative-impedance spectra. Among other things, differential spectra have the ability to track the rate of change in impedance as a function of an independent variable. By contrast, relative impedance spectra eliminate surface influence, which opens the way to the direct comparison of physicochemical processes and more.},

A --CPEox{$\parallel$}Rox-- element was used to characterise the oxide layer on Zr--1\%Nb. Both the CPEox coefficient, {$\sigma$}ox, and the parallel resistance, Rox, were found to be thickness dependent. The layer thickness, however, can only be calculated after a calibration procedure. The temperature dependence of the CPEox element was also found to be anomalous while the temperature dependence of Rox indicates that the oxide layer has semiconductor properties. The relaxation time -- defined as (Rox{$\sigma$}ox)1/{$\alpha$} -- was found to be quasi-independent of oxidation time and temperature; thus it is characteristic to the oxide layer on Zr--1\%Nb.}

Its main virtue is the short measurement time, reducing the danger of contamination of the electrode surface. To further the use of dEIS, we have recently elaborated a set of theories aimed at the related data processing for three groups of fundamental electrode reactions: diffusion-affected charge transfer, charge transfer of surface-bound species, and adsorption--desorption. These theories yielded equations by which the voltammograms can be transformed to potential-program invariant forms, allowing an easy calculation of the rate coefficients; similar equations have been derived for the potential dependence of equivalent circuit parameters obtained from the impedance spectra. In this Perspective, the above derivations are condensed into a single, unified one. The theory is recommended to evaluate electrode kinetic measurements, particularly when the potential dependence of rate coefficients is under study.},

The same applies also to DEIS (dynamic EIS) measurements, when high frequency impedance spectra are measured while the potential is scanned to simultaneously accomplish cyclic voltammetry or other transient measurements. In case of DEIS both the charge transfer resistance and the Warburg coefficient depend on the applied potential program, e.g. on scan-rate. A theory is presented, yielding a transformation by which this dependence can be eliminated. The proposed procedure yields two, scan-rate independent, hysteresis-free functions, which are closely related to the EIS results, and also to the functions which are the transformed forms of the cyclic voltammograms as suggested in T. Pajkossy, S. Vesztergom, Electrochim. Acta, 297 (2019) 1121. To illustrate the properties of the transformations and the functions involved, numerical simulations are also presented.

By this method, a number of audio-frequency impedance spectra were measured on a gold electrode in an aqueous solution of K4[Fe(CN)6] while taking cyclic voltammograms (the CVs were taken with 50--200 mV/s scan-rate; the distance of potentials of impedance spectra was 16 mV). The Faradaic impedance elements were determined from the spectra, from them charge transfer rate coefficients were calculated; it was found to be 0.11 cm/s at the formal potential. This set of measurements demonstrates the main advantage of dEIS over the traditional steady state impedance measurements: dEIS characterization of an electrochemical system can be performed in seconds rather than minutes which makes possible to use freshly prepared (e.g., annealed) electrodes with reduced risk of contamination or modification of their surfaces.},
